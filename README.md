### Grief watch

Currently griefed:

- W.I.P SECTION NOT FINISHED

## Help against griefers!

If you'd like to help fight against griefers, click the coordinates inside the pages to be sent to their locations on wplace.

If you use any overlay mods,
I've sometimes provided JSON files for [Overlay Pro](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/545041-wplace-overlay-pro)
inside the README.md of art.

The reference images will update as well due to them being hosted on my Git repo, so its generally just nice to work with.

## Contribute art!

If you'd like to add art to this repository, you can!

Open up an [issue](https://github.com/FlooferLand/wplace-art/issues) (to ask for it to be added), or a [pull request](https://github.com/FlooferLand/wplace-art/pulls) (to add it yourself).

Make sure you are *NOT* modifying any markdown *(md)* files yourself as those are automatically generated.

## License

Some of these artworks have no license, some do. Always check before using any of them

View the `LICENSE.md` of each directory respectively, as some are my own works.

## Other stuff

*Feel free to contact me at Discord on [AT] flooferland*

*I also recommend you buy or build Aseprite from source to view the aseprite files.*
