# wplace-art

This repo contains a bunch of art I'm making for wplace,
as well as art I'm helping maintain.

## Help out!

If you'd like to help, click the coordinates inside the README files to be sent to their locations.

If you use any overlay mods, I've sometimes provided JSON files for [Overlay Pro](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/545041-wplace-overlay-pro) inside the README.md of art.

Feel free to contact me at Discord on \[AT\] flooferland

I recommend you buy or build Aseprite from source to view the aseprite files.

Here is the [free colour palette](./wplace_free_palette.png) btw

## License

Some of these artworks have no license.

View the `LICENSE.md` of each directory respectively, as some are my own works.
