## Help out!

If you'd like to help, click the coordinates inside the pages to be sent to their locations on wplace.

If you use any overlay mods,
I've sometimes provided JSON files for [Overlay Pro](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/545041-wplace-overlay-pro)
inside the README.md of art.

The reference images will update as well due to them being hosted on my Git repo, so its generally just nice to work with.

*Feel free to contact me at Discord on [AT] flooferland*

*I also recommend you buy or build Aseprite from source to view the aseprite files.*

## License

Some of these artworks have no license, some do. Always check before using any of them

View the `LICENSE.md` of each directory respectively, as some are my own works.
